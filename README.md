# starting-project-110

Note for self reverted back to end of lesson 111 as adding useeffect cleanup function on master broke the login functionality. Go through lesson 113 again on this branch to workout why I broke login/out functionality. Once working make PR to master so you can see where you went wrong. However was unable to push after detaching HEAD at f76736d as doing so created a branch with name f76736d for some unknown reason. Ended up mergin branches loccally and pushing master so all good now.
